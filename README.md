# Quicksilver
## New, modern base theme for PhpBB forum system.

The goal of this project is to bring PhpBB styling into XXI century:
- modern, sematic HTML5 elements instead of styled definition lists
- responsive pages
- as little JavaScript as possible
- SCSS styles included
- replace static images with icons and styling
- make most popular extensions work out of the box
- use Twig modular design
